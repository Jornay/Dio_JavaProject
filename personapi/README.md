<h2>Digital Innovation: Expert class - Developing a REST API people management system with Spring Boot</h2>

In this live coding we will develop a small system for managing people in a company through a REST API, created with Spring Boot.

During the session, the following topics will be developed and addressed:

* 
Initial Project Setup with Spring Boot Initializer 
* Creating a data model for mapping entities into databases
* Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removing people from a system).
* Relation of each of the operations above with the REST architectural pattern, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during project development.
* Development of unit tests for functionality validation.
* Cloud system deployment through Heroku.

To run the project on the terminal, type the following command:

```shell script
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After executing the above command, just open the following address and view the project execution:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/people
```

The following prerequisites are necessary for the execution of the project developed during the class:

* Java 11 or higher versions.
* Maven 3.6.3 or higher versions.
* Intellj IDEA Community Edition or your favorite IDE.
* GIT version control installed on your machine.
* GitHub account for cloud storage of your project.
* Heroku account to deploy the project in the cloud.
* Willing to learn and share knowledge :)
